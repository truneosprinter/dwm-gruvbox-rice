# dwm-gruvbox-rice
A simple DWM gruvbox-themed rice that I daily drove for about 6 months on my Thinkpad x250!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Install Instructions:
First I would insist that you read install.sh to make sure that you are comfortable with the commands running on your system!
If you are ok with that, please run

  ```chmod +x install.sh```

to make the install file executable, and then run yhe install file as non-root user with the command:

  ```./install.sh```

It is better with a fresh install of archlinux!

This should get most features working after a reboot. Please feel free to edit /etc/issue to create your own login page if you don't like mine, and of course you can do the same with any other parts of the rice.
